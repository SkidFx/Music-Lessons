            <p>I was 8 or 9 years old when i began my love of Heavy Metal Guitar. This was the era of MTV when Hair Metal Dominated the World.
                Back then Bon Jovi and Ozzy Osbourne ruled the Rock World with Rock Star beauty and bad boy Attitude. </br> It was common practice for my older brother and I to (baby-sit) my cousins, who were only a year younger than I at the time; it was more for peace of mind to our parents we were together while they were dancing the night away at some club or disco. 
            </br></br> These evenings always began the same, playing as kids our age did, but at 11 pm every Saturday night, MTV hosted the Head Bangers Ball!
                It was at this time the Air Guitars(broom and mop handles), drum sets(coffe and inn tables), Mics(lamps) were located. We then set up stage, and began rocking out to all the hits, only to take a break when MTV played a "B" Side or new song we had yet to hear.
                It was those memorable nights in which we each immitated our favorite artist such as Dokken, GnR, Ratt, Dio, Motley Crue, Poison, Warrant, Kixx, Jovi, Ozzy, or Winger; this was my awakening where my thirst to learn how to play guitar began. </br></br>
                I have never played a gig or have i ever joined a band, life led me on another journey as a father of 6, my work has moved me all over Texas and Louisiana, no my dream of being a rock god died off long ago, but my appitite for music is alive and kicking.
                I was 22 years old when i got my first guitar, and i have not looked back since. I have been learning ever since, 25 Years, I struggle with technique and theory same as any other Non-gifted player does.
                But slowly over time and countless hours of practice, I have gotten better, to the point that I do consider myself an Intermediate player. One which can recognize and play in any key, solo over backing tracks, and understands some theory.
            </br></br> My journey continues, striving to get better each day i pick up my axe. Still the young Rocker in me gets lost in thoughts of being 8 years old playing to my fans in the arena, --- Well Ok-- my cousins, MTV, and my trusted axe aka "Aunt Trudys' broom".
